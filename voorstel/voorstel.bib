  abstract={Assets identification is an important aspect of penetration test on which security practitioner develop their defense mechanism. In addition, assets identification is an essential piece of information for penetration testers to find a weakness in the targeted organization. Information gathering is the process of extracting knowledge to recognize the organizations' assets available on the internet. There are many open source tools available for information gathering. However, penetration tester needs to put manual effort (during several hours to multiple days) to extract useful knowledge from the output of one tool and integrate that knowledge in another tool. Penetration tester can increase speed and accuracy of the overall information gathering process by automating the knowledge extraction and integration. This paper review and identify open source subdomain enumeration and service scanning tools and present an approach to integrate and automate identified tools. The result reveals that there is a significant improvement of the information gathering process by using our approach due to the reduction of manual tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Penetration testing (also known as pentesting or PT) is a common practice for actively assessing the defenses of a computer network by planning and executing all possible attacks to discover and exploit existing vulnerabilities. Current penetration testing methods are increasingly becoming non-standard, composite and resource-consuming despite the use of evolving tools. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an AI-based pentesting system which makes use of machine learning techniques, namely reinforcement learning (RL) to learn and reproduce average and complex pentesting activities. The proposed system is named Intelligent Automated Penetration Testing System (IAPTS) consisting of a module that integrates with industrial PT frameworks to enable them to capture information, learn from experience, and reproduce tests in future similar testing cases. IAPTS aims to save human resources while producing much-enhanced results in terms of time consumption, reliability and frequency of testing. IAPTS takes the approach of modeling PT environments and tasks as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) problem which is solved by POMDP-solver. Although the scope of this paper is limited to network infrastructures PT planning and not the entire practice, the obtained results support the hypothesis that RL can enhance PT beyond the capabilities of any human PT expert in terms of time consumed, covered attacking vectors, accuracy and reliability of the outputs. In addition, this work tackles the complex problem of expertise capturing and re-use by allowing the IAPTS learning module to store and re-use PT policies in the same way that a human PT expert would learn but in a more efficient way.},
